# Abaqus-Welding-Simulation-Two-Pass-Arc-Welding
2-Pass Welding Simulation in Abaqus: In this project, we used Abaqus with the DFLUX subroutine to simulate2-pass welding, incorporating the birth and death of elements. This is a workshop of a package covering the simulation of multiple welding methods, presented in 3.5 hours of video. All files and videos are available through the provided link.
